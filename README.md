# Data Structures in C

Implementations of common data structures written in C for learning and practice.

## Purpose
To deepen understanding of both the C language and core data structures and algorithms by building them from scratch.  
The goal is to explore memory management, pointer manipulation, and design patterns that form the foundation of efficient C programs.

## Reference
Primary reference:  
**Mark Allen Weiss â€” _Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C_**

## Implementations
(Current and planned)
- Stack (linked list)
- Queue (linked list)
- Linked List (singly and doubly)
- Tree structures
- Hash table
- Graph representations and traversal algorithms
- Sorting and searching algorithms

## Notes
- Code written for clarity and correctness, not library-level polish.
- Manual memory management (malloc/free) is explicit.
- No external dependencies; compiles with `gcc` or any C99+ compiler.

## Compile and Run
Example (Stack):
```bash
cd stack
gcc stack.c main.c -o stack
./stack
```

## Learning Objectives
- Strengthen control over raw memory and pointers.
- Reinforce algorithmic reasoning independent of high-level abstractions.
- Build intuition for time and space complexity through direct implementation.
